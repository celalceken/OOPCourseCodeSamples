# Air Conditioning(AC) System Project
**Objective**: For the assignment, students will develop a software system that allows users to monitor and control an AC system remotely. The system involves a login process for registered users, live temperature monitoring, and control of the AC system. Students will also be required to write at least two tests for the modules using JUnit.

## Assignment Overview:
### System Description:

An AC system with a functioning electromechanical setup but a non-working controller needs to be managed remotely through an internet-enabled smart device. The smart device consists of a main processing platform and peripheral units such as an actuator, a temperature sensor, and a network interface.
Users will be able to view the temperature and control the AC system remotely via the internet, following a successful login process.
### User Operations:

Registered users can log in to the system, view live temperature data, open or close the AC system, and log out.
The live temperature data will be simulated using a random function, and a label will be shown to indicate whether the AC system is open or closed.
### Project Requirements:

* Develop a Requirement List: Students must list functional and non-functional requirements for the system.
* Class Diagram: Students will draw a class diagram to represent the design of the system, focusing on components such as User, Login, AC System, Temperature Sensor, Actuator, and Network Interface.
* Database Design: PostgreSQL will be used to manage user data, including user registration, login information, and operation logs.
* GUI: The system's user interface should be implemented using the Swing API, providing functionality for login, viewing temperature, and controlling the AC system.
* Testing:Students must implement at least two unit tests using JUnit, testing critical modules such as the login process and the temperature control functionality.
## Assessment:
For the assignment, students will be evaluated during the last week of class. They are expected to present their running program, demonstrate all the codes, and submit the documents they prepared during the project development process. The assessment will include a project evaluation as well as an oral examination to ensure that students have a solid understanding of both their implementation and the theoretical aspects of the project.
