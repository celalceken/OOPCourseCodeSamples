# Polymorphism
    Polymorphism is a result of inheritance. 
    A derived class can be treated as an instance of its base class 
    because it inherits all the properties and behaviors of the base class.
    The derived class shows polymorphic behavior.
    Polymorphism significantly boosts code reuse and makes changes and extensions easier.

## Exercise
    Modify the application to also support the Square shape. The Square class should inherit from the Shape class, 
    include a sideLength attribute, and override the toString() method. Ensure that the square's details  displayed.
