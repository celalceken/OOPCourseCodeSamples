# Abstraction in OOP

    Abstraction in object-oriented programming facilitates program development by separating design from implementation.
    Through abstraction a developer focuses on what a class can do rather than how it does it. It hides the 
    complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary functionalities to the user. This allows users to interact 
    with an object using a simplified interface, without needing to understand the underlying complexity.    

    Abstraction is essential in OOP because it reduces complexity, enhances code maintainability, facilitates scalability, 
    and enables parallel development. It simplifies the design by providing a clear separation between what an object does 
    and how it does it

    Abstract classes and interfaces are two mechanisms that foster abstraction by providing a blueprint or contract for other classes.
