# Encapsulation
* Refers to the inclusion of data and the methods that use this data within a single structure (class).
* It allows for the details within the object to be hidden from other objects.
* Data and the methods using this data come together to form a class. Since direct access to the data is not desired, its access level is set to "private". Objects can interact with each other through "public" methods. Thus:

  * Complex problems are broken down into smaller parts. Each part can be developed independently.
  * Changes made to an object do not affect other objects.
  * Reusability of modules in other projects or different parts of the same project increases.
  * Testing the application becomes easier.
## Exercises
    The example application requires the circle object to also include label (String) information. Update the constructor, set, get, and toString methods as necessary.
    Form a circle object within the main method and ensure that all methods are used.
