* GUI Components Setup: The app creates a login form using Java Swing with fields for username, password, a "Remember Me" checkbox, and a "Forgot Password" button.
  * Login Process: When the user clicks the "Login" button, the app checks if the entered username and password are both "2".
  * If correct, a success message is displayed, and the app redirects to a "Successfully logged in" page.
  * If incorrect, an error message is shown using a dialog box.
* Additional Features: The "Remember Me" checkbox simulates saving preferences, and the "Forgot Password" button prompts a recovery message.

## Exercise: Integrate the login screen into the previously developed ATM application.
