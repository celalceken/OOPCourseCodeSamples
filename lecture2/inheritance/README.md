# Inheritance
Facilitating changes is essential in programming. Code reuse is one of the most important mechanisms to achieve this. 
Instead of writing the same piece of code multiple times, we write it once and use it several times in various places 
within a project or across different projects. Inheritance is a fundamental OOP feature that maximizes code reuse.

    Allows classes to be derived from other classes, preventing code repetition.
    Should be used between similar entities (e.g., "is a", "is kind of" relationships).
    The derived class inherits the members of the base class.
    May significantly maximize the code reuse.

# Modeling
    it is the simplified representation of reality. 
    Simplification helps in managing complexity and improving our ability to design, analyze, and 
    communicate about systems.
    We use (Unified Modeling Language) because it provides a standardized way to simplify and represent 
    complex systems.
    UML provides various diagrams to represent different aspects of a system.
    Class Diagram shows the static structure of a system, including classes, attributes, methods, and 
    relationships between classes.

## Exercise

    1. Make the necessary adjustments to the existing shape application to include a new Square class.
    2. Modify the shape classes to support positioning in a 3-dimensional space. Add a new instance 
    variable z for the third dimension and make any necessary changes to methods and constructors.
    3. Add a method that calculates the perimeter.
