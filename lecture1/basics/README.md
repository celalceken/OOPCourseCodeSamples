# Objects in Java

    "We aim to develop a drawing application. We need to create a Circle with radius, x and y coordinates, 
    and color properties. The Circle's area should also be calculated." 
    After analyzing this requirement list, we identified Circle as an object, with 
    radius, x, y coordinates, and color as its attributes, and the calculate area function as its method.

# Exercises
    The example application requires the circle object to also include label (String) information. Update the constructor, 
    set, get, and toString methods as necessary.
    Form a circle object within the main method and ensure that all methods are used.
