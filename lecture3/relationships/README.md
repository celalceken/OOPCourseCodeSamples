# Class Relationships
### Association ("Has a")
    Describes a relationship where one class has another class as an attribute. 
    we can use "has a" term to describe this relationship.
    Derivatives are composition (strong ownership) and aggregation (weak ownership).
    
### Inheritance ("Is a"):
    Describes a relationship where a class is a subclass of another class.
    
### Dependency ("Uses"):
    Describes a temporary relationship where one class uses another to perform a task.
    Example: A Teacher "uses" a Projector.
